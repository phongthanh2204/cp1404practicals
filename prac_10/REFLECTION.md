# Reflections on Practical Tasks, Code Reviews, and Course Improvements

## Estimates in Practical Tasks

Initially, my accuracy in estimating the time and resources needed for practical tasks was somewhat off. This was primarily due to underestimating the complexity of certain tasks and overestimating my proficiency in certain areas. However, as the course progressed, I consciously began to factor in potential hurdles and learning curves, which improved my estimation accuracy significantly. I learned that accurate estimation is not just about understanding the task at hand, but also about knowing one's own working style and capabilities.

## Learning from Code Reviews

Participating in code reviews, both as a reviewer and a review, has been highly educational. When my code was reviewed, I learned to see my work from another perspective, which often highlighted areas for improvement that I hadn't considered. I also learned the importance of writing clear, maintainable code, as this makes it easier for others to understand and critique. Conversely, when reviewing others' code, I learned different coding styles and approaches. It broadened my understanding of how problems can be solved in multiple ways, each with its own merits and demerits.

## Practical Tasks: Changes if in Charge

If I were in charge of the subject, I would implement more collaborative practical tasks. Currently, most tasks are individual, which limits the opportunity for peer learning. By incorporating more team-based assignments, students can learn from each other's strengths, work on their communication skills, and get exposed to different coding styles and problem-solving approaches.
